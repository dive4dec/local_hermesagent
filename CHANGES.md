## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-14

### Fixed

#### Approval error messaging
- **Permission buttons now show error when approval fails** — previously,
  if the user clicked Approve/Reject after the agent had timed out or the
  bridge had restarted, the buttons either silently re-enabled (no feedback)
  or showed a generic error. Three failure modes now display a clear message:
  1. **Expired permission** (agent timed out or bridge restarted): the bridge
     tracks pending permissions in `_pending_permissions`; when the stream
     ends (done/timeout/error/abort/process exit), the set is cleared. The
     `/session/permission` endpoint returns: "This permission request has
     expired — the agent may have timed out or moved on."
  2. **Bridge unreachable** (process down): `api.php` detects
     `curl_exec() === false` and returns: "Bridge unreachable: <curl error>"
  3. **Server unreachable** (network error): `chat.js` `.fail()` handler
     shows: "⚠ Failed to reach server: <status>"
- **`api.php`** — `api_permission_response()` now captures `curl_error()`,
  decodes the bridge JSON response, and checks `status === "error"` to pass
  the bridge's error message through to the browser (was returning generic
  "Bridge error").
- **`acp_bridge.py`** — `_pending_permissions` set tracks active permission
  IDs; cleared on all stream exit paths (done, timeout, error, abort, process
  exit); `discard()` on successful response. Abort path now clears
  permissions (was missing).
- **`chat.js`** — `.done()` handler checks `resp.status === "error"` and
  displays the message; `.fail()` handler shows error text instead of
  silently re-enabling buttons.

#### Bootstrap cross-platform support
- **`bootstrap.sh` now works on macOS and WSL2** (in addition to Alpine musl
  and glibc Linux). Platform detection via `uname -s` / `uname -m`:
  - macOS Intel: darwin x86_64 builds (Python, uv, ripgrep, Node.js)
  - macOS Apple Silicon: darwin aarch64 builds
  - WSL2: detected as Linux glibc — uses gnu builds
  - macOS Gatekeeper fix: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` on downloaded
    binaries (same as hermes-usb-portable)
- **aarch64 fixes**: ripgrep has no musl aarch64 build — uses gnu build
  (statically linked, works on musl). Node.js has no musl aarch64 build —
  falls back to gnu build.
- **`CONFIG_FILE` env var fix** — Python config writer had env vars after
  the command (passed as argv, not environment). Fixed with `export` before
  the Python call.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed

#### Abort / Stop streaming (critical)
- **Abort now properly stops streaming and prevents stale messages** —
  previously, after clicking Stop, the `hermes acp` process kept running
  and writing to the shared inbox queue. The next prompt would pick up
  stale messages from the aborted session, producing garbled output.
  Three fixes applied to `acp_bridge.py`:
  1. `abort_event` passed into `send_prompt_streaming()` — checked during
     the 0.5s inbox wait gap to break early instead of hanging.
  2. `session_id` filtering — `session/update` notifications with the
     wrong `session_id` are discarded, preventing cross-session pollution.
  3. Inbox drain (3 rounds × 0.3s pauses) after abort to clear residual
     messages.
- Tested: `prompt_in_progress` releases within 2s, SSE sends
  `event: aborted`, new prompt after abort produces clean output.

#### Settings page Stop button (critical)
- **Stop button now actually stops the bridge** — the bridge was running
  as **root** (started via `kubectl exec`), but PHP-FPM runs as
  `www-data`. The `kill` command silently failed because `www-data`
  cannot kill root-owned processes. Fixed by killing root processes and
  restarting as `www-data` via the control script.
- **`hermes-bridge-control.sh`** now warns when `kill` fails:
  "WARNING: cannot kill pid X" instead of silent failure.

#### Settings page status freshness
- **"Stopped — will auto-start on first chat"** → just **"Stopped"**.
  The bridge does not auto-start; this message was misleading.
- **Status now refreshes after stop/start/restart** — added
  cache-busting `?t=time()` parameter to the redirect URL so the page
  re-renders with fresh bridge health.
- **Post-stop verification** — after calling stop, checks bridge health
  and warns if still running (e.g. "ACP Bridge may not have stopped —
  check that it is running as www-data, not root").

#### Conversation timestamp
- **Timestamp now reflects the latest message** —
  `save_assistant_response()` only updated the message's `timemodified`
  but not the conversation's. The sidebar showed the time of the user's
  last message, not the assistant's reply. Now both `send_message` and
  `save_assistant_response` update `conv->timemodified`.

### Changed

#### Conversation history management
- **ACP session ID persisted to Moodle DB** — the `acp_session_id`
  column existed in `local_hermesagent_conversations` but was never
  used. Now saved from the bridge's SSE response on every prompt.
- **History sent on new sessions after bridge restart** — previously,
  the conversation→ACP session mapping was in-memory only
  (`acp._sessions = {}`). When the bridge restarted, all mappings were
  lost and each conversation got a new empty ACP session — the agent
  forgot all prior context. Now, when creating a new session, the bridge
  includes conversation history in the first prompt so the agent has
  context.
- **History limited to 40 most recent messages** (~20 user+assistant
  turns) to prevent context window overflow on long conversations.
  Character-based safety net in the bridge: `MAX_HISTORY_CHARS=50000`
  (~12K tokens) with truncation note.
- **`session/load` not used** — hermes acp's `session/load` often fails
  ("Failed to recreate agent" for old sessions), so we always create
  fresh sessions and include history in the prompt instead.
- **Subsequent prompts only send the latest message** — relies on the
  ACP session's internal memory with automatic compaction
  (`archive_and_compact` at 50% of context window). No duplication.
- **`api.php` sends `messages` array and `acp_session_id`** to the
  bridge on every request; the bridge decides whether to include history
  based on `is_new_session`.

#### Chat sidebar
- **Removed bridge status indicator from chat sidebar footer** — it was
  stale (only checked at page load) and polling would be inefficient.
  The settings page is the authoritative place for bridge status.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

#### Conversation management
- **Bulk delete / duplicate** — long-press (mobile) or right-click (desktop)
  on a conversation in the sidebar to enter selection mode. Checkboxes
  appear on each conversation; tap to toggle. Bulk Delete (with
  confirmation) and Bulk Duplicate buttons appear in a toolbar. ✕ exits
  selection mode.
- **Per-conversation duplicate button** (⧉) — visible on hover, creates a
  full copy of the conversation with all messages.
- New web services: `bulk_delete_conversations`, `duplicate_conversation`.

#### Quote / reply to messages
- **↩ Quote button** on every message bubble — click to show a visual
  quote preview bar above the input with "Quoting Hermes:" or "Quoting
  me:" and the first 200 characters of the quoted message.
- When sent, the quote is prepended as a markdown blockquote
  (`> **Hermes said:**\n> ...`) so Hermes sees the context.
- ✕ on the quote bar cancels. Quote auto-clears after sending.
- **Blockquote styling** — indigo left border (3px), light gray
  background, works in both user and assistant bubbles.

#### Edit / delete individual messages
- **✎ Edit button** — click to inline-edit: message content turns into a
  textarea with Save/Cancel buttons. Markdown re-renders after saving.
- **🗑 Delete button** — deletes with confirmation, message fades out.
- New web services: `edit_message`, `delete_message`.
- Message IDs are now passed from `send_message` → `addUserMessage` so
  edit/delete buttons have correct DB IDs. The `send_message` web service
  is called first (returns `messageid`), then the SSE stream opens.

#### Image paste support
- **Ctrl+V an image** into the input textarea — automatically uploads and
  inserts a markdown image link.
- Images saved as flat files to `/var/www/moodledata/.hermes/images/`
  (owned by `www-data`, 0644 permissions).
- **`image.php`** — serves images for browser display (requires login,
  no pluginfile complexity). `renderMarkdown` rewrites local file paths
  to `image.php?f=filename` URLs for display.
- The markdown sent to Hermes uses the **local filesystem path** so
  Hermes can read the file directly via `vision_analyze` — no
  authentication needed (previous pluginfile.php approach required
  session cookies Hermes couldn't provide).
- New web service: `upload_image`.
- 10MB size limit per image.

#### Collapsible + resizable sidebar
- **◀ Collapse button** in sidebar header — hides sidebar completely.
- **▶ Expand button** appears when collapsed — click to restore.
- **Drag handle** (6px gray bar) between sidebar and chat area — drag to
  resize from 160px to 500px. Turns indigo on hover/drag.
- Sidebar width **persists** across page loads via `localStorage`.
- **Touch support** for resizing on tablets.
- Mobile (< 600px): resize/collapse buttons hidden, uses header-tap
  to expand/collapse (sidebar shows as 42px tappable header bar).

#### Per-message copy & text selection
- **📋 Copy button** on every message — copies raw markdown/text to
  clipboard (navigator.clipboard + execCommand fallback).
- **Double-click** message content to select all text in that bubble.
- Normal click-drag text selection for partial copying.

#### Vision support
- **`auxiliary.vision` configured** in `config.yaml` to use the custom
  provider (`custom:Socratic.cs.cityu.edu.hk` / `Socrates` model).
  Previously set to `auto` which couldn't detect the custom provider,
  causing "No LLM provider configured for task=vision" errors.
- `bootstrap.sh` updated to set this on future deploys.

### Fixed

- **`local_hermesagent_get_bridge_port()` undefined** — `lib.php` was
  accidentally overwritten with only the `pluginfile()` function,
  deleting all 11 helper functions. Restored all original functions and
  appended `pluginfile()` at the end.
- **`services.php` double backslashes** — 6 service entries had
  `\\\\` (double-escaped) instead of `\\` in the classname field. This
  prevented Moodle from finding the class.
- **`tool_response()` missing `global $USER`** — would fail with
  "undefined variable" when checking permissions.
- **Markdown not rendering after sending** — user messages were rendered
  with `escapeHtml()` (plain text), so blockquote `>` syntax showed as
  raw characters. Now both user and assistant messages go through
  `renderMarkdown()`.
- **Closure bug in `renderMessages`** — async `renderMarkdown().then()`
  callbacks captured loop variables by reference, so all messages would
  render into the last element. Fixed with IIFE wrapper.
- **Resize handle invisible** — was inside the sidebar div (child, not
  sibling); the sidebar's flex/overflow layout swallowed it. Moved
  outside the sidebar closing tag. Also gave it a visible background.
- **Mobile sidebar not tappable** — `max-height: 0` hid the header too.
  Changed to `max-height: 42px` so the header is always visible.
- **Removed unused `external_optional_param` import** from `chat_api.php`.
- **Removed unused `core/str` import** from `chat.js` AMD define().
- **Removed dead `bulkMode` variable** — was set but never read; the
  `.hermes-bulk-mode` CSS class on items is the actual state indicator.
- **Removed dead tool confirmation modal** HTML from `chat.php` (was
  replaced by inline permission buttons in 0.3.11).

### Changed

- `sendMessage()` now calls `send_message` web service first to get the
  message ID, then opens the SSE stream. Previously `streamResponse()`
  called `send_message` internally.
- `saveAssistantResponse()` now returns the ajax promise so the `done`
  event handler can use the returned `messageid` for action buttons.
- `buildMessageActions()` helper centralizes action button HTML
  generation (reply, copy, edit, delete) for all message render paths.
- Sidebar `min-width` changed from 260px to 160px for more flexibility.

---

## [0.3.11] — 2026-07-08

### Added

#### Tool approval (inline, non-blocking)
- **Inline approve/reject buttons** in the chat stream — when Hermes wants
  to execute a tool (write_file, terminal, etc.), a yellow-tinted permission
  bubble appears inline in the chat with the tool name, a diff/description,
  and Approve / Reject buttons. Non-blocking: you can scroll, read context,
  and approve later. Multiple pending requests each get their own buttons.
  After clicking, buttons are replaced with "✓ Approved" or "✗ Rejected".
- **Bridge forwards `session/request_permission`** as an SSE `permission`
  event to the browser (was previously auto-approved silently by the bridge).
- **`POST /session/permission`** endpoint on the bridge — receives the
  browser's approval/rejection and sends the correct ACP
  `RequestPermissionResponse` back to the `hermes acp` process.
- **`permission_response` action** in `api.php` — bridges the browser's
  POST to the bridge's `/session/permission` endpoint.
- **`scripts/patch_acp_timeout.py`** — patches the ACP adapter
  (`acp_adapter/permissions.py` and `edit_approval.py`) to read
  `ACP_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` env var instead of the hardcoded 60s default.
  Called automatically by `bootstrap.sh` after every `hermes update`.

#### Mobile / foldable responsive chat
- **Collapsible sidebar** — on phones (< 600px), the conversation list
  collapses to a tappable header with a ▼ indicator. Tap to expand/collapse.
- **Foldable layout** (601–1024px) — 220px sidebar, 85% message width,
  compact conversation items. No more cramped full-width sidebar.
- **iOS zoom prevention** — `font-size: 16px` on the input textarea.
- **Compact bubbles** — smaller avatars, tighter padding on mobile.

### Fixed

- **Tool approval "Unknown tool"** — the bridge looked for `params.call.*`
  but the ACP protocol sends `params.toolCall.*` with `rawInput.tool` and
  `rawInput.arguments`. Now correctly extracts tool name (e.g.
  `write_file: /tmp/hello.py`, `terminal: cat > /tmp/hello.py`).

- **Tool approval "Connection error"** — three root causes, all fixed:
  1. **ACP 60s internal timeout** — `acp_adapter/permissions.py` and
     `edit_approval.py` hardcode a 60s `future.result(timeout=60)` that is
     separate from `config.yaml`'s `approvals.timeout`. Patched to read
     `ACP_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` env var (default 600s). The
     `hermes-bridge-control.sh` script now exports
     `ACP_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT=600`.
  2. **Wrong ACP response format** — the bridge sent
     `{"result": {"status": "accepted"}}` but the ACP protocol's
     `RequestPermissionResponse` expects
     `{"result": {"outcome": {"outcome": "selected", "optionId": "allow_once"}}}`
     for approve, or `{"result": {"outcome": {"outcome": "cancelled"}}}`
     for reject. The old format caused a Pydantic validation error and the
     ACP treated it as "denied" — even when the approval arrived in 0.39s.
  3. **`PARAM_ALPHA` stripped underscores** — Moodle's `PARAM_ALPHA` only
     allows a–z and silently strips everything else. `permission_response`
     was converted to `permissionresponse`, which didn't match any `switch`
     case — so `api_permission_response()` was never called and the
     browser's approval was silently discarded. Changed to
     `PARAM_ALPHANUMEXT` (allows a–z, 0–9, `_`, `-`).

- **Chat stuck loading / send button not working** — Moodle's AMD loader
  only serves files from `amd/build/`, not `amd/src/`. The stale
  `amd/build/chat.js` (from June 16, old code with `handleToolResponse`)
  was being served instead of the updated source. Created
  `amd/build/chat.js` and `amd/build/chat.min.js` as copies of the source.

- **Bridge deadlocks after failed approval** — when the SSE stream drops
  or the ACP times out waiting for a permission response, the prompt lock
  is never released, causing all subsequent requests to fail with
  `TimeoutError: Timed out waiting for ACP response to session/new`.
  Restarting the bridge clears the lock.

- **`config.yaml` `approvals.timeout: 600`** — set in both the live config
  and `bootstrap.sh` so the CLI callbacks path also uses 600s (was 60s).

### Changed

- **`api.php` cURL timeout** increased from 300s to 600s to allow time for
  tool approval within a single SSE stream.
- **`acp_bridge.py` ACP timeout** increased from 300s to 600s.
- **`_handle_notification`** for `session/request_permission` now returns
  `False` (don't consume) instead of `True`, letting the streaming loop
  handle the permission event and yield it to the browser.

---

## [0.3.10] — 2026-07-08

### Added

#### Messaging Gateway (multi-platform)
- **`hermes-gateway-control.sh`** — process manager for the Hermes gateway
  (start/stop/restart/status via nohup + PID file). Connects Hermes to
  messaging platforms so you can chat with the AI from Element, Telegram,
  Discord, Signal, and 15+ other apps.
- **Gateway `.env` direct editor** on the settings page — paste any
  platform's environment variables (one per line). Supports all Hermes
  gateway platforms: Matrix, Telegram, Discord, Signal, Mattermost, IRC,
  Email, Line, Feishu, DingTalk, Google Chat, QQ, ntfy, BlueBubbles, etc.
- **Gateway status panel** with Start/Stop/Restart buttons and last log
  line display. Detects any platform config by checking for known env var
  prefixes in the `.env` file.

#### File-based config editors
- **`classes/admin/setting_configfile.php`** — custom `admin_setting` class
  that reads/writes a file directly (not the Moodle DB). The file is the
  single source of truth — no stale DB copy. Edits via Moodle, the
  dashboard, or the CLI all modify the same file. Used by both config.yaml
  and gateway `.env`.
- **Hermes config.yaml direct editor** on the settings page — edit the
  full Hermes configuration (model, provider, agent settings, toolsets,
  etc.) directly. Changes are written to `$HERMES_HOME/config.yaml` on save.

#### Other
- **Configurable dashboard port** — new `dashboard_port` setting (default
  9119), read by `dashboard.php` when starting the dashboard.
- **`local_hermesagent_is_gateway_running()`** /
  **`is_gateway_configured()`** helper functions in `lib.php`.
- **Documentation links** — 📖 Configuration docs under config.yaml,
  📖 Gateway docs under `.env`.

### Changed

#### Settings page redesign
- **Four clear sections** with proper headings: Tools, ACP Bridge, Hermes
  Configuration, Messaging Gateway.
- **"Tools" section** (renamed from "Quick Links") — each tool now has a
  description: Chat, Terminal, Dashboard, Update & Bootstrap, Docs. Laid
  out as a table with button + description.
- **Shorter button labels** — "Chat" (was "Open Hermes Chat"), "Terminal"
  (was "Open Terminal"), "Restart"/"Stop"/"Start" (dropped "ACP"/"Gateway"
  suffixes since context is clear from section heading).
- **No duplicate buttons** — Dashboard only in Tools (removed from gateway
  section), Update & Bootstrap moved to Tools (removed from bridge section).
- **Port fields use static defaults** — `'9118'` and `'9119'` passed
  directly to constructors instead of reading stale DB values.

### Fixed

- **`admin_setting_configpassword` not found** — Moodle doesn't have this
  class; replaced with `admin_setting_configpasswordunmask` (then later
  removed entirely when Matrix-specific fields were replaced with the
  generic `.env` textarea).
- **Stale `bridge_port = 0`** — empty field was cast to `0` by `PARAM_INT`
  and stored in DB, shown instead of the default `9118`. Fixed by using
  static defaults and clearing the DB value.

---

## [0.3.9] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

#### Dashboard proxy
- **CSS font path rewriting** — the dashboard CSS references fonts via
  `url(/assets/...)` and `url(/fonts-terminal/...)` which bypassed the
  proxy and returned 404. Now rewrites `url()` references in CSS responses
  so fonts load through `dashboard.php/assets/...` and
  `dashboard.php/fonts-terminal/...`.
- **WebSocket retry spam suppressed** — the dashboard SPA uses WebSockets
  for real-time features (embedded chat, PTY terminal, event streaming)
  which PHP-FPM cannot proxy. Set `__HERMES_DASHBOARD_EMBEDDED_CHAT__=false`
  to disable the embedded chat widget, and injected a WebSocket guard
  script that silently rejects `ws://`/`wss://` connections targeting
  `dashboard.php` so the browser doesn't retry endlessly.

---

## [0.3.8] — 2026-07-07

### Fixed

#### ACP Bridge concurrency (critical)
- **Prompt serialization lock** — added `_prompt_lock` to `acp_bridge.py`
  preventing concurrent prompts from mixing responses in the shared inbox
  queue. `hermes acp` is a single stdio process that can only handle one
  prompt at a time; without the lock, two simultaneous chat requests would
  steal each other's streaming chunks.
- **New `/status` endpoint** — reports `prompt_in_progress`, `sessions`
  count, and `pid` without blocking on the prompt lock.
- **`/health` endpoint** — clarified as non-blocking (does not acquire the
  prompt lock).

#### Moodle freeze elimination
- **Removed DB writes from health check** — `lib.php` no longer calls
  `local_hermesagent_set_setting('bridge_status', ...)` on every health
  check. This was causing DB lock contention under concurrent access.
- **Reduced `sleep(3)` to `sleep(1)`** in `ensure_bridge_running()` — less
  blocking of PHP-FPM workers during lazy bridge startup.
- **Settings page health check** — reduced from 2s timeout to instant
  (< 1ms) since it no longer does DB writes.

#### Settings page overhaul
- **Start/Stop/Restart buttons** — now work correctly via
  `hermes-bridge-control.sh`. The old tmux-based code in
  `settings_action.php` was completely dead (Architecture 1) and never
  worked because tmux ran as root while PHP-FPM runs as www-data.
- **Health polling after start/restart** — the settings page now polls the
  `/health` endpoint for up to 20s (every 1s) instead of doing a single
  check after `sleep(3)`. The bridge takes ~10s to boot; the old code
  always reported "not responding" because it checked too early.
- **Dynamic button state** — when the bridge is running, shows "Restart"
  (yellow) + "Stop" (red). When stopped, shows "Start" (green). Always
  shows "Update & Bootstrap" (blue) and "Dashboard" (primary).

#### Terminal fixes
- **PATH now set correctly** — `exec.php` exports `HERMES_HOME` and
  prepends `venv/bin` to `PATH` in the generated shell script, so `hermes`
  is directly available without typing the full path. Previously, `$PATH`
  was interpolated by PHP as an empty string, wiping `/bin`, `/usr/bin`
  and causing `rm: not found` and similar errors.
- **Quick-action buttons** — added buttons for common non-interactive
  commands: `hermes --version`, `hermes config`, `hermes mcp list`,
  `hermes tools list`, `hermes acp --check`, `hermes status`.
- **Environment info** — terminal page now displays the `HERMES_HOME` path
  and notes that interactive TUI (`hermes chat`) is not supported; users
  should use `hermes chat -q` for single queries or the chat page.

#### Bootstrap script
- **Removed tmux checks** — the old `bootstrap.sh` checked for tmux
  sessions at the end, which always reported "NOT running" even when the
  bridge was fine. Now checks `curl /health` instead.
- **Fixed `/tmp/acp_bridge.py` copy** — was trying to copy from `/tmp/`
  which doesn't exist; now copies from the plugin directory.
- **Fixed `.bashrc` accumulation** — removed the `echo >> .bashrc` lines
  that duplicated PATH exports on every run.
- **Fixed busybox `cp` compatibility** — `cp -f` doesn't work on Alpine's
  busybox; replaced with `rm -f && cp`.
- **Removed `set -e`** — caused premature exit on non-fatal errors (e.g.,
  pip warnings).
- **Made MCP config creation idempotent** — uses `grep` check before
  adding moodle_db MCP server config.

#### Bridge control script
- **Fixed `status` command** — was checking nonexistent `PROXY_PID_FILE`
  and `ACP_PID_FILE`; now uses `BRIDGE_PID_FILE`.
- **Fixed bridge script path** — prefers the persistent copy at
  `$HERMES_HOME/classes/bridge/acp_bridge.py` (survives plugin re-syncs),
  falls back to the plugin directory.
- **Added `BRIDGE_PORT` env var support.**
- **Added health check in `status` output.**

### Added

#### Hermes Dashboard proxy
- **`dashboard.php`** — reverse proxy for the Hermes web dashboard
  (port 9119). Auto-starts the dashboard on first access, injects the
  session token for API authentication, and rewrites HTML asset paths so
  the SPA works behind the Moodle `/edb/` subpath.
- **Dashboard button** on the settings page (opens in new tab).
- The dashboard provides a full web UI for Hermes config, sessions, MCP
  servers, tools, model settings — accessible at
  `/local/hermesagent/dashboard.php/` without needing a separate port or
  direct network access.

### Removed

#### Dead code cleanup
- **`proxy_forward.py`** (root) — deleted. This was the old Architecture 2
  that bypassed `hermes acp` entirely, had a hardcoded API key, and
  conflicted over port 9118 with the ACP bridge.
- **`scripts/hermes_proxy_forward.py`** — deleted. Duplicate/divergent
  copy of `proxy_forward.py`.
- **All tmux code** removed from `settings_action.php` — the Start/Stop/
  Restart buttons now use `hermes-bridge-control.sh`.

### Migration notes

If upgrading from 0.3.7:
1. Run `make sync` to deploy the updated plugin files.
2. Run `make purge` to clear Moodle caches.
3. Copy the updated `acp_bridge.py` to the persistent location:
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -n edb phpfpm-0 -- cp \
     /var/www/html/public/local/hermesagent/classes/bridge/acp_bridge.py \
     /var/www/moodledata/.hermes/classes/bridge/acp_bridge.py
   ```
4. Click "Restart ACP" on the settings page to pick up the new bridge code.
5. Click "Update & Bootstrap" to run the fixed bootstrap script.
